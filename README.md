The easiest way to leverage this is the notebook using the final functions in the notebook:

Note:
the aThesis... files are checkpoints in the path of finishing a project for school. These will not likely have the most functional, documented, and intuitive code. Stick to Grouping&GeneratingFlorezRodriguez.ipynb notebook and demo PDFs.
